## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites üìã

- Bash shell (usually available by default on Linux and macOS)

### Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Send2ChatBot.git

  ### Configure `config.yaml`:

Create a configuration file named `config.yaml` in the `~/.custom_path/` directory. Fill in the necessary details for both Telegram and Discord:

```yaml
discord:
  - id: "crawl"
    discord_channel: "crawl"
    discord_username: "test"
    discord_format: "{{data}}"
    discord_webhook_url: "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXXXXXXX"
telegram:
  - id: "tel"
    telegram_api_key: "XXXXXXXXXXXX"
    telegram_chat_id: "XXXXXXXX"
    telegram_format: "{{data}}"
    telegram_parsemode: "Markdown"
```
### Make the Script Executable:
```
chmod +x Send2ChatBot.sh
```
## Usage üì¶
```bash
To send a file to Telegram:

./Send2ChatBot.sh -t /path/to/your/file.txt

To send a file to Discord:

./Send2ChatBot.sh -d /path/to/your/file.txt
To send a file to both platforms (if configurations exist for both):

./Send2ChatBot.sh /path/to/your/file.txt

```

Use the following flags to specify the destination:

- `-t`: Send the file to Telegram.
- `-d`: Send the file to Discord.
- No flag: If configurations exist for both platforms, the file will be sent to both.

**Note:** Before using the script to send messages and files, ensure that you've properly configured your `config.yaml` file with the necessary API keys, chat IDs, and webhook URLs. Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to the file you want to send.
